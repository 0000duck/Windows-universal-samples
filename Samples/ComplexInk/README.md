# ComplexInk sample
This sample demonstrates how to use advanced InkPresenter functionality to achieve scenarios such as interleaving ink with other objects, selecting ink, copy/paste, and event handling.  It is built upon the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) in C++ and can run on both Desktop and Mobile Windows 10 SKUs.

Specifically, this sample covers using the [**Windows.UI.Input.Inking**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208524) APIs to:
-   Render ink strokes onto app specified VSIS surface
-   Erase ink strokes via mode toggle or eraser button
-   Select ink strokes via mode toggle or barrel button drag

**Note**  Read the following instructions before using the app.

-   Draw ink strokes with a tablet pen, or with finger when Touch Inking Mode is enabled.  Mouse can not be used to ink in this sample.
-   Activate the selection mode by hold the pen barrel button and drag on inking surface.  Alternatively, checking the Selection Mode combobox.
-   Press Clear button to erase all content from the inking area.
-   Press Insert Shape to insert random geometric shape on top of existing ink.  Ink can interleave on top of existing shapes.
-   Touch inking mode can be toggled with Enable Touch Inking checkbox.  When touch inking is enabled, both pen and finger can ink.
-   With touch inking disabled, pen can ink while finger manipulates the inking surface.
-   All buttons and menu choices can be activated with mouse, pen, or touch.
-   Message box at the bottom of the page will report any events generated by current active inking input devices.
