This sample demonstrates how to use ink functionality (such as capturing ink from user input and performing handwriting recognition on ink strokes) in Universal Windows apps using C#.

Specifically, this sample covers using the Windows.UI.Input.Inking APIs to do the following:
-   Capture user input and render as ink strokes
-   Save and load ink strokes
-   Erase ink strokes
-   Change which input types (Mouse/Touch/Pen) are used for inking 
-   Recognize handwriting from ink strokes 
-   Select ink strokes
