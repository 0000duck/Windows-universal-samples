3. One-shot recognition using the predefined dictation grammar
4. One-shot recognition using the predefined webs search grammar
5. One-shot recognition using a custom list-based grammar
6. One-shot recognition using a custom SRGS/GRXML grammar
7. Continuous dictation
8. Continuous recognition using a custom list-based grammar
9. Continuous recognition using a custom SRGS/GRXML grammar
10. Pausing and resuming continuous recognition 

In addition, translations are shown for speech recognition and text-to-speech for supported languages. Translations provided may not be using ideal phrasing and are provided for demonstration purposes only.
